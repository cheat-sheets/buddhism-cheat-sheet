## Four Noble Truths

The Four Truths express the basic orientation of Buddhism: we **crave and cling** to impermanent states and things, 
which is **dukkha**. But there is a way to liberation from dukkha to the state of **nirvana**, namely following the 
**Noble Eightfold Path**.

- **1. The existence of suffering** (dukkha). Dukkha is most commonly translated as "suffering", but this is inaccurate, 
since it refers not to episodic suffering, but to the intrinsically unsatisfactory nature of temporary states and 
things, including pleasant but temporary experiences. Dukkha can be translated as "*incapable of satisfying*" 
instead of suffering.
- **2. The cause of suffering** - craving and clinging to impermanent things: sense-pleasures, life, craving to not 
experience the painful feelings.
- **3. The cessation of suffering** - Nirvana - extinction of craving, peace of mind.
- **4. The eightfold path** - the path to Nirvana:
  - Right view
  - Right thought
  - Right speech
  - Right action
  - Right livelihood
  - Right effort
  - Right mindfulness
  - Right concentration

### Evolutionary Psychology and Dukkha

[Dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) is believed to be responsible for craving and clinging to 
pleasurable things such as food, sex, positive emotions. It's an evolutionary mechanism for attracting humans to things
that are favorable for survival and transmitting our genes to the next generation.

Another evolutionary mechanism is positive and negative **emotions**, i.e. something favorable for our survival can cause 
happiness or surprise, and something dangerous can cause anger, fear, sadness, disgust. 

The emotions **can't be trusted** because they have been "designed" by evolution long time ago and optimized for an 
environment different from where we live now. The environment was more dangerous and competitive millions of years ago.
Even millions of years is not enough for evolution to *apply changes* to the original design.

[Default mode network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network) in the brain is activated when a person is 
not doing anything in particular e.g. daydreaming or mind-wandering. At this point he is usually 
thinking about something in the past or the future, and the things that have a strong negative or positive connotation, 
in other words emotional things. When meditating the default mode is much less active in the brain. 
By meditating we prohibit our brain to be reactive and instead be more objective.
Meditation can be thought of as an exercise in which we suppress our brain in reacting to things with strong emotional 
connotation.

## Non-Self

[Annata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta) refers to the doctrine of "**non-self**", that there is no unchanging, 
permanent self, soul or essence in living beings.

**The structure of the Buddha's argument of non-self**:
 
There are **5 aggregates** that constitutes *everything* there is about a person:

- Body
- Perception 
- Feeling
- Mental formations
- Consciousness

All of these aggregates are:

- Impermanent (i.e. they don't persist through time, changeable)
- Not under our control 

A *self* is something that's permanent and something we can control, thus there is no *self*.

It can be understood as - a person is nothing more than a biological robot. There is no single command center or a soul
that controls it.
